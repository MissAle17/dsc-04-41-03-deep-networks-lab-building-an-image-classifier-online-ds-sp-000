    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we'll create a network with more than one hidden layer from scratch. The outline of this lab will be roughly the same as the previous two labs, but you'll notice that adding more hidden layers makes forward and backward propagation more complex. This is what you'll do:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You'll start with initializing the parameters in all the layers.\n",
    "- You'll implement the forward propagation module:\n",
    "     - First, you'll combine a linear step and a activation function in a linear forward function.\n",
    "     - Next, you'll stack the linear forward function L-1 time with a RELU activation function (for layers 1 through L-1) and then add a sigmoid layer at the end (for the final layer $L$). \n",
    "- You'll create the loss function.\n",
    "- You'll implement the backward propagation module using three helper functions:\n",
    "    - First, you'll create a function for the linear part of a layer's backward propagation step.\n",
    "    - Next, we'll tell you how to get the gradients for the activation functions (RELU and sigmoid) and you'll implement this along with the linear part of the activation step to create a backward function.\n",
    "    - Lastly, you'll stack the backward function L-1 times with the RELU activation and add the sigmoid activation in the $L$th layer in a new L_model_backward function\n",
    "- You'll conclude your model by updating the parameters\n",
    "- At the end of this lab, you'll combine all the helper functions in a function called `L_layer_model` and apply this model to the Santa data set you've used before!\n",
